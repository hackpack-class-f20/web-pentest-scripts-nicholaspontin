## Environment Overview

For my pentest environment I have chosent to use the basic tools recommended by my professor. These tools include burp community edition and google chrome. In order to start my pentest environment I have enacted a batch file script to start both of the tools. Along with this I also execute another command in my script that sets up the manual proxy for my machine so that burp is in control of the requests and responses being sent. I have included my batch file in the repository so that it can be viewed. I was able to complete this script after talking with my instructor about tailoring an environment for my windows machine.
